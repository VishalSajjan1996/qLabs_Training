  <h2>1. Lion</h2>
  <h3><strong>Lion</strong></h3>
  <p>The <em>Lion</em> (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India.
     It has a muscular, broad-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of
      its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male <em>Lion</em> are larger than females and have a prominent mane.
       It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A <em>Lion</em> pride consists of a few adult males, 
       related females, and cubs. Groups of female <em>Lion</em> usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. 
       The <em>Lion</em> is an apex and keystone predator; although some <em>Lion</em> scavenge when opportunities occur and have 
       been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not actively seek out and prey on humans.</p>

    <h2>2. Tiger</h2>
    <h3><strong>Tiger</strong></h3>   
    <p>The <em>tiger</em> (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is
         most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, 
         it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but
          social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing
          of its offspring. <em>Tiger</em> cubs stay with their mother for about two years and then become independent, leaving their
           mother's home range to establish their own</p>

    <h2>3. Cheetah</h2>
    <h3><strong>Cheetah</strong></h3>
    <p>The <em>cheetah</em> (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat native to Africa and central Iran. It is the fastest land animal, estimated to be
         capable of running at 80 to 128 km/h (50 to 80 mph) with the fastest reliably recorded speeds being 93 and 98 km/h (58 and 61 mph), 
         and as such has several adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail. It typically reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in)
          at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in).</p>

    <h2>4. Bear</h2>
    <h2><strong>Bear</strong></h2>
    <p><em>Bears</em> are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight 
        species of <em>Bear</em> extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and 
        partially in the Southern Hemisphere. <em>Bear</em> are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common
         characteristics of modern <em>Bear</em> include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade
         paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.</p>

    <h2>5. Horse</h2>
    <h3><strong>Horse</strong></h3>
    <p>The <em>horse</em> (Equus ferus caballus)[2][3] is a domesticated, one-toed, hoofed mammal. It belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae 
        and is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. The <em>Horse</em> has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed
         creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating <em>Horse</em> around 4000 BC, and their domestication
          is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. <em>Horse</em> in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations
          live in the wild as feral <em>horse</em>. These feral populations are not true wild <em>Horse</em>, as this term is used to describe <em>Horse</em> that have never</p>
