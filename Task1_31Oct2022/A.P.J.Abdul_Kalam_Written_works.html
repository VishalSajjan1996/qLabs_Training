    <h2>5. Wings of Fire: An Autobiography</h2>
    <h3><strong>Wings of Fire: An Autobiography</strong></h3>
    <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, the son of a little-educated
         boat-owner in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, had an unparalleled career
          as a defence scientist, culminating in the highest civilian award
           of India, the Bharat Ratna. As chief of the country's defence 
           research and development programme, Kalam demonstrated the great
            potential for dynamism and innovation that existed in seemingly 
            moribund research establishments.</p>
