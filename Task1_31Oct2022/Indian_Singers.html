          regarded as one of the greatest, most influential and dynamic singers in
           the history of Indian music.[13][14] He was one of the most popular singers
            in the Indian subcontinent, notable for his yodeling and ability to sing
             songs in different voices.[15] He used to sing in different genres but

               <em>Kishore Kumar</em> was so successful as a singer because his "voice hits
